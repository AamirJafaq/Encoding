# Encoding
In machine learning, encoding refers to the process of converting categorical data or non-numeric information into a numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Many machine learning models require numerical input, so encoding is essential for transforming non-numeric data into a suitable format.\
Some common types of encoding techniques are label encoding, one-hot encoding and ordinal encoding.
